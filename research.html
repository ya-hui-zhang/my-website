  <section>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      Our group works on theoretical condensed matter physics with an emphasis on
      strongly correlated quantum systems. We develop analytical and numerical
      approaches to understand exotic quantum phases of matter and quantum phase transitions.
      Below are our four main research directions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 1. Moire Systems ===== -->
  <section id="moire">
    <h2>Moir&eacute; Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Moir&eacute; superlattices&mdash;formed by stacking two-dimensional materials with a small
      twist angle or lattice mismatch&mdash;provide a highly tunable platform for engineering
      nearly flat topological bands where electron&ndash;electron interactions dominate.
      These systems offer unprecedented opportunities to realize and control exotic quantum
      phases of matter in a tabletop setting.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases</strong> &mdash;
        A central goal is to understand and predict topological phases that emerge at zero
        magnetic field in moir&eacute; materials and rhombohedral multilayer graphene.
        Key questions include identifying new fractional quantum anomalous Hall states,
        understanding quantum anomalous Hall crystals and their interplay with topology,
        and characterizing the quantum phase transitions between these phases and conventional states.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mott physics in strongly correlated topological bands</strong> &mdash;
        When interaction effects are strong enough to localize electrons in topological flat bands,
        a rich landscape of correlated insulating states emerges, including topological Mott insulators,
        pseudogap metals, and exotic magnetic orders. We aim to develop a unified theoretical
        framework for these phenomena, connecting moir&eacute; Mott physics to the broader
        problem of doped Mott insulators in condensed matter.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Theory of superconductivity for twisted bilayer graphene</strong> &mdash;
        The mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene remains one of the most
        important open questions in the field. We are developing theories based on strong-coupling
        approaches&mdash;including resonating valence bond states, doped fractional Chern insulators,
        and t&ndash;J model physics&mdash;to explain the origin and symmetry of the superconducting order
        and its connection to the nearby correlated insulating phases.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 2. Cuprate & Nickelate Superconductors ===== -->
  <section id="superconductors">
    <h2>Cuprate &amp; Nickelate Superconductors</h2>
    <p>
      High-temperature superconductivity remains one of the central open problems in
      condensed matter physics. We develop new theoretical frameworks to understand the
      cuprate and the recently discovered nickelate superconductors, with the broader goal
      of uncovering universal principles that govern unconventional superconductivity
      in strongly correlated materials.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ancilla qubit theory of the pseudogap metal</strong> &mdash;
        The pseudogap regime in underdoped cuprates defies description by conventional
        Fermi liquid theory. We develop a novel theoretical framework using ancilla
        qubits to construct variational wavefunctions that capture the essential physics
        of Mott insulators and pseudogap metals. This approach provides a new lens for
        understanding the transition between the pseudogap state and the Fermi liquid,
        and connects naturally to topological order and fractionalization.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bilayer nickelate La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></strong> &mdash;
        The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate
        La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> opens a new chapter in the study of
        correlated superconductors. We are developing strong-coupling theories based on
        multi-orbital t&ndash;J models that incorporate Hund&rsquo;s rule physics, aiming to
        understand the pairing mechanism, the role of interlayer coupling, and the
        connection between nickelates and cuprates.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Non-Fermi liquid criticality with Fermi surface volume jump</strong> &mdash;
        A key feature of strongly correlated metals is the possibility of quantum phase
        transitions accompanied by a discontinuous change in the Fermi surface volume.
        We investigate the nature of such deconfined critical points, the emergence of
        non-Fermi liquid behavior and ghost Fermi surfaces, and the potential for novel
        superconducting instabilities driven by quantum criticality.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 3. Fractional Phases ===== -->
  <section id="fractional">
    <h2>Fractional Phases</h2>
    <p>
      Fractionalization&mdash;where the collective behavior of many electrons gives rise to
      emergent quasiparticles carrying fractional quantum numbers&mdash;is one of the most
      profound phenomena in quantum many-body physics. We explore how fractionalized phases
      emerge, how they can be detected, and what new states of matter arise when they are
      tuned or perturbed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantum spin liquids</strong> &mdash;
        Quantum spin liquids are exotic magnetic states that evade conventional symmetry-breaking
        order and instead support fractionalized spinon excitations and emergent gauge fields.
        We investigate the stability, classification, and experimental signatures of spin liquids
        in frustrated magnets and moir&eacute; systems, as well as the unconventional
        superconductors and metals that emerge upon doping these phases.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quantum Hall multilayers</strong> &mdash;
        Stacking quantum Hall layers opens a route to engineering new topological phases through
        interlayer coherence and exciton condensation. We study fractional exciton condensates,
        anyon superfluids, and the interplay between quantum Hall physics and Hubbard model
        physics in multilayer moir&eacute; systems, aiming to bridge two foundational paradigms
        in condensed matter theory.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Deconfined quantum phase transitions</strong> &mdash;
        Conventional Landau theory fails to describe certain quantum phase transitions where
        fractionalized degrees of freedom emerge at the critical point. We explore deconfined
        quantum criticalities, dualities between seemingly distinct topological phases, and
        the broader consequences of these ideas for understanding quantum matter beyond the
        Landau paradigm.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 4. Numerical Methods ===== -->
  <section id="numerical">
    <h2>Numerical Methods</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to analytical approaches, our group actively develops and applies
      state-of-the-art numerical methods to study strongly correlated quantum systems.
      By going beyond mean-field descriptions, we aim to obtain controlled and unbiased results
      for challenging many-body problems where analytical methods alone are insufficient.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)</strong> &mdash;
        DMRG is one of the most powerful methods for one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional
        quantum systems. We use DMRG to study quantum criticality, exotic superconducting
        states, and entanglement properties in strongly correlated models, providing
        benchmarks and insights that guide our analytical theories.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)</strong> &mdash;
        VMC provides a flexible framework for constructing and optimizing physically motivated
        trial wavefunctions in two dimensions. We develop new classes of variational states&mdash;including
        those based on ancilla qubits and parton constructions&mdash;to capture Mott physics,
        Fermi surface reconstruction, and fractionalization in correlated electron systems.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Neural network quantum states</strong> &mdash;
        Neural network ansatze offer a promising new paradigm for representing quantum
        many-body wavefunctions, with the expressive power to capture complex entanglement
        structures that challenge traditional approaches. We are exploring how these methods
        can be combined with physical insights to tackle open problems in strongly correlated systems.
