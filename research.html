    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      Our group works on theoretical condensed matter physics with an emphasis on
      strongly correlated quantum systems. We develop analytical and numerical
      approaches to understand exotic quantum phases of matter and quantum phase transitions.
      Below are our four main research directions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 1. Moire Systems ===== -->
  <section id="moire">
    <h2>Moir&eacute; Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Moir&eacute; superlattices formed by stacking two-dimensional materials with a small
      twist angle or lattice mismatch host nearly flat Chern bands where interaction effects
      dominate, giving rise to a rich variety of correlated and topological quantum phases.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases</strong> &mdash;
        We predicted nearly flat Chern bands in moir&eacute; superlattices
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.075127" target="_blank">[2]</a>
        and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer
        graphene in the moir&eacute;less limit
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.206504" target="_blank">[39]</a>.
        We continue to explore possible fractional phases in moir&eacute; materials and
        multilayer graphene, as well as the quantum phase transitions between these
        topological states and conventional phases.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mott physics in strongly correlated topological bands</strong> &mdash;
        We are broadly interested in understanding the novel Mott physics that arises
        in topological flat bands
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.112.085107" target="_blank">[48]</a>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00139" target="_blank">[p2]</a>.
        A key distinction from conventional Mott insulators is the momentum-selective
        Mott gap: the Mott gap becomes small or vanishes at certain momentum points,
      </li>
      <li><strong>Theory of superconductivity for twisted bilayer graphene</strong> &mdash;
        We proposed a theory of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene based on
        pairing from a small Fermi surface
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26801" target="_blank">[p9]</a>.
        This approach naturally explains the two-gap structure and the pseudogap observed
        in tunneling experiments, providing a unified picture of the superconducting state
        and its connection to the nearby correlated insulating phases.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 2. Cuprate & Nickelate Superconductors ===== -->
  <section id="superconductors">
    <h2>Cuprate &amp; Nickelate Superconductors</h2>
    <p>
      High-temperature superconductivity remains one of the central open problems in
      condensed matter physics. We develop new theoretical frameworks to understand the
      cuprate and the recently discovered nickelate superconductors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ancilla qubit theory of the pseudogap metal</strong> &mdash;
        We developed a mean-field theory that explains Fermi arcs and the pseudogap
        by hybridizing the electron with an ancilla fermion
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.112.115159" target="_blank">[49]</a>.
        This provides, to our knowledge, the first wavefunction of the FL* phase
        within the Hilbert space of the one-band Hubbard model.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bilayer nickelate La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></strong> &mdash;
        We proposed a Type-II t&ndash;J model for superconducting
        La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.174511" target="_blank">[30]</a>
        and showed that kinetic energy can drive strong pairing even when the attractive
        interlayer exchange J<sub>&perp;</sub> is canceled by a repulsive V
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.104517" target="_blank">[37]</a>.
        See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02673" target="_blank">[p7]</a> for a review.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Non-Fermi liquid criticality with Fermi surface volume jump</strong> &mdash;
        We aim to understand the quantum criticality between a pseudogap metal
        (with a small Fermi surface) and a Fermi liquid, and its connection to
        strange metal behavior. The symmetric Fermi liquid (SFL) to Fermi liquid
        transition in a bilayer model
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.125122" target="_blank">[36]</a>
        provides a wonderful example of a Fermi surface volume-changing transition
        without the distractions from symmetry breaking or fractionalization.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 3. Fractional Phases ===== -->
  <section id="fractional">
    <h2>Fractional Phases</h2>
    <p>
      Quantum spin liquids host fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields.
      We study these exotic phases and their connections to quantum Hall physics,
      topological order, and unconventional superconductivity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantum spin liquids</strong> &mdash;
        Quantum spin liquids are exotic states of matter that evade conventional
        symmetry-breaking order and host fractionalized excitations. We are particularly
        interested in realizing quantum spin liquids in moir&eacute; systems
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.247701" target="_blank">[18]</a>,
        where the high tunability offers new opportunities for their detection and control.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quantum Hall multilayers</strong> &mdash;
        Stacking quantum Hall layers enables exotic interlayer-coherent states such as
        fractional exciton condensates
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.031023" target="_blank">[28]</a>
        and anyon superfluids
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00058" target="_blank">[p5]</a>,
        opening a rich playground for engineering new topological phases through
        interlayer coherence.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Deconfined quantum phase transitions</strong> &mdash;
        We investigated deconfined criticalities and dualities between chiral spin liquid,
        topological superconductor and charge density wave Chern insulator
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.15.5.215" target="_blank">[26]</a>,
        and studied phase transitions out of quantum Hall states in moir&eacute; materials
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.085143" target="_blank">[32]</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ===== 4. Numerical Methods ===== -->
  <section id="numerical">
    <h2>Numerical Methods</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to analytical approaches, our group actively develops and applies
      state-of-the-art numerical methods to study strongly correlated quantum systems,
      going beyond mean-field descriptions to obtain unbiased results for challenging many-body problems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)</strong> &mdash;
        DMRG is one of the most powerful methods for one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional
        quantum systems. We use DMRG to study quantum criticality, exotic superconducting
        states, and entanglement properties in strongly correlated models, providing
        benchmarks and insights that guide our analytical theories.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)</strong> &mdash;
        VMC provides a flexible framework for constructing and optimizing physically motivated
        trial wavefunctions in two dimensions. We develop new classes of variational states
        to capture Mott physics, Fermi surface reconstruction, and fractionalization
        in correlated electron systems.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Neural network quantum states</strong> &mdash;
        Neural network ansatze offer a promising new paradigm for representing quantum
        many-body wavefunctions, with the expressive power to capture complex entanglement
        structures. We are exploring how these methods can be combined with physical insights
        to tackle open problems in strongly correlated systems.
