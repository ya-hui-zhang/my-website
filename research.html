    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      Our group works on theoretical condensed matter physics with an emphasis on
      strongly correlated quantum systems. We develop analytical and numerical
      approaches to understand exotic quantum phases of matter and quantum phase transitions.
      Below are our four main research directions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== 1. Cuprate & Nickelate Superconductors ===== -->
  <section id="superconductors">
    <h2>Cuprate &amp; Nickelate Superconductors</h2>
    <p>
      High-temperature superconductivity remains one of the central open problems in
      condensed matter physics. We develop new theoretical frameworks to understand the
      cuprate and the recently discovered nickelate superconductors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ancilla theory of pseudogap metal in underdoped cuprates</strong> &mdash;
        We developed a mean-field theory that explains Fermi arcs and the pseudogap
        by hybridizing the electron with an ancilla fermion. Beyond mean field, we
        construct a variational wavefunction by introducing ancilla qubits and then
        projecting them out
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.112.115159" target="_blank">[49]</a>.
        This provides, to our knowledge, the first wavefunction of the FL* phase
        within the Hilbert space of the one-band Hubbard model.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bilayer nickelate La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></strong> &mdash;
        We proposed a Type-II t&ndash;J model for superconducting
        La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.174511" target="_blank">[30]</a>
        and showed that kinetic energy can drive strong pairing even when the attractive
        interaction from J<sub>&perp;</sub> is canceled by a repulsive V
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.104517" target="_blank">[37]</a>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07292" target="_blank">[p1]</a>.
        Beyond mean field, J<sub>&perp;</sub> penalizes the S=1 doublon state, frustrating
        single-electron motion so that pairing saves kinetic energy&mdash;a mechanism
        beyond the mean-field decoupling common to most other approaches.
        See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02673" target="_blank">[p7]</a> for a review.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Non-Fermi liquid criticality with Fermi surface volume jump</strong> &mdash;
        We aim to understand the quantum criticality between a pseudogap metal
        (with a small Fermi surface) and a Fermi liquid, and its connection to
        strange metal behavior. The second Fermi liquid (sFL) to Fermi liquid
        transition in a bilayer model
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.125122" target="_blank">[36]</a>
        provides a wonderful example of a Fermi surface volume-changing transition
        without the distractions from symmetry breaking or fractionalization.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ===== 2. Moire Systems ===== -->
  <section id="moire">
    <h2>Moir&eacute; Superlattices and 2D Materials</h2>
    <p>
      Moir&eacute; superlattices formed by stacking two-dimensional materials with a small
      twist angle or lattice mismatch can produce narrow bands in which the electron kinetic
      energy is strongly quenched relative to the Coulomb interaction. The resulting flat-band
      systems&mdash;which may or may not carry a Chern number&mdash;provide a highly tunable
      platform for realizing a remarkable variety of strongly correlated and topological
      quantum phases, including correlated insulators, unconventional superconductors, and
      integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases</strong> &mdash;
        We predicted nearly flat Chern bands in moir&eacute; superlattices
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.075127" target="_blank">[2]</a>
        and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer
        graphene in the moir&eacute;less limit
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.206504" target="_blank">[39]</a>.
        We continue to explore possible fractional phases in moir&eacute; materials and
        multilayer graphene, as well as the quantum phase transitions between these
        topological states and conventional phases.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mott physics in strongly correlated topological bands</strong> &mdash;
        We are broadly interested in understanding the novel Mott physics that arises
        in topological flat bands
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.112.085107" target="_blank">[48]</a>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00139" target="_blank">[p2]</a>.
        A key distinction from conventional Mott insulators is the momentum-selective
        Mott gap: the Mott gap becomes small or vanishes at certain momentum points.
        Moreover, the Mott&ndash;Hubbard bands may themselves become topological, so that
        the final phase hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk localized spin moments.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Theory of superconductivity for twisted bilayer graphene</strong> &mdash;
        We proposed a theory of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene based on
        pairing from a small Fermi surface
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26801" target="_blank">[p9]</a>.
        This approach naturally explains the
        two gap structure below T<sub>c</sub> and the pseudogap above T<sub>c</sub> observed in tunneling experiments.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Chiral superconductivity</strong> &mdash;
        We are interested in understanding how chiral superconductivity can emerge
        in purely spinless models with Coulomb interaction alone. This question is
        potentially relevant to recent discoveries in pentalayer graphene and twisted
        MoTe<sub>2</sub>. The chiral superconductor is particularly exciting because
        it likely hosts Majorana zero modes.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ===== 3. Fractional Phases ===== -->
  <section id="fractional">
    <h2>Fractional Phases</h2>
    <p>
      Fractionalization&mdash;where electrons collectively give rise to emergent
      quasiparticles carrying fractional quantum numbers&mdash;is a central theme in
      modern condensed matter physics.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantum spin liquids</strong> &mdash;
        Quantum spin liquids are exotic states of matter that evade conventional
        symmetry-breaking order and host fractionalized excitations. We are particularly
        interested in realizing quantum spin liquids in moir&eacute; systems
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.247701" target="_blank">[18]</a>,
        where the high tunability offers new opportunities for their detection and control.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quantum Hall multilayers</strong> &mdash;
        Stacking quantum Hall layers enables exotic interlayer-coherent states such as
        fractional exciton condensates
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.031023" target="_blank">[28]</a>
        and anyon superfluids
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00058" target="_blank">[p5]</a>,
        opening a rich playground for engineering new topological phases through
        interlayer coherence.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Deconfined quantum phase transitions</strong> &mdash;
        We investigated deconfined criticalities and dualities between chiral spin liquid,
        topological superconductor and charge density wave Chern insulator
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.15.5.215" target="_blank">[26]</a>,
        and studied phase transitions out of quantum Hall states in moir&eacute; materials
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.085143" target="_blank">[32]</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ===== 4. Numerical Methods ===== -->
  <section id="numerical">
    <h2>Numerical Methods</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to analytical approaches, our group actively develops and applies
      numerical methods to study strongly correlated quantum systems,
      going beyond mean-field descriptions to obtain unbiased results for challenging many-body problems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)</strong> &mdash;
        We use DMRG to study quantum criticality and exotic phases in one-dimensional
        and quasi-one-dimensional models, providing benchmarks for our analytical theories.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)</strong> &mdash;
        We develop new classes of variational wavefunctions in two dimensions to capture
        Mott physics, Fermi surface reconstruction, and fractionalization.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)</strong> &mdash;
        We use DMFT to study correlated physics including pseudogap,
        non-Fermi liquid behavior, and superconductivity. One recent
        application is on bilayer nickelate.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Neural network quantum states</strong> &mdash;
        We explore neural network ansatze as expressive variational wavefunctions
        for strongly correlated systems.
      </li>
    </ul>
