    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      Our group works on theoretical condensed matter physics with an emphasis on
      strongly correlated quantum systems. We develop analytical and numerical
      approaches to understand exotic quantum phases of matter and quantum phase transitions.
      Below are our four main research directions.

  <!-- ===== 1. Moire Systems ===== -->
  <section id="moire">
    <h2>Moir&eacute; Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Moir&eacute; superlattices formed by stacking two-dimensional materials with a small
      twist angle or lattice mismatch have emerged as a remarkably tunable platform
      for studying strongly correlated physics. The resulting flat bands enhance
      interaction effects and give rise to a rich variety of quantum phases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work in this area includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects</strong> &mdash;
        We predicted fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir&eacute; systems
        at zero magnetic field, including in rhombohedral multilayer graphene
        and twisted MoTe<sub>2</sub>. We also proposed new classes of quantum
        anomalous Hall crystals in multilayer graphene.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fractional quantum spin Hall effects</strong> &mdash;
        We introduced the concept of a vortex spin liquid that realizes
        a fractional quantum spin Hall effect in moir&eacute; Chern bands,
        and studied its non-Abelian and Abelian descendants.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Correlated insulators and magnetism</strong> &mdash;
        We have studied the nature of correlated Chern insulators, ferromagnetism,
        and topological electronic crystals in twisted graphene systems,
        in close collaboration with experimental groups.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Topological flat bands</strong> &mdash;
        We predicted nearly flat Chern bands in moir&eacute; superlattices
        and developed lattice models for twisted bilayer graphene aligned
        with hexagonal boron nitride.

  <!-- ===== 2. Cuprate & Nickelate Superconductors ===== -->
  <section id="superconductors">
    <h2>Cuprate &amp; Nickelate Superconductors</h2>
    <p>
      High-temperature superconductivity remains one of the central open problems in
      condensed matter physics. We develop new theoretical frameworks to understand the
      cuprate and the recently discovered nickelate superconductors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work in this area includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ancilla qubit theory of the pseudogap metal</strong> &mdash;
        We developed a new approach using ancilla (auxiliary) qubits to describe
        the transition from the pseudogap metal to the Fermi liquid in cuprates.
        This framework provides variational wavefunctions for the Mott insulator
        and the pseudogap metal that capture their essential topological properties.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bilayer nickelate La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></strong> &mdash;
        Following the discovery of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity in pressurized
        La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, we proposed a Type-II t-J model
        with shared superexchange coupling from Hund's rule, and studied strong
        pairing from a small Fermi surface beyond weak coupling.
        We also studied the symmetric pseudogap metal phase using a double Kondo lattice model.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pair-density waves and d-wave superconductivity</strong> &mdash;
        We studied pair-density-wave superconductors from doping Haldane chains,
        and developed models of d-wave superconductivity with coexisting antiferromagnetism
        and charge order on the square lattice.

  <!-- ===== 3. Fractional Phases ===== -->
  <section id="fractional">
    <h2>Fractional Phases</h2>
    <p>
      Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter in which spins remain disordered
      even at zero temperature due to strong quantum fluctuations. They host
      fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields, and are closely connected
      to topological order.

      Our work in this area includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chiral and Dirac spin liquids</strong> &mdash;
        We studied chiral spin liquids, Dirac spin liquids, and their connections
        to topological superconductors via dualities.
        We also investigated SU(4) chiral spin liquids in moir&eacute; bilayers
        and spin liquids on the square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quantum Hall multilayer systems</strong> &mdash;
        We studied the interplay of quantum Hall physics with moir&eacute; systems
        and bilayer structures, including the XY* transition and extraordinary
        boundary criticality from fractional exciton condensation in quantum Hall
        bilayers, exciton supersolids, and quantum Hall spin liquid states
        in trilayer moir&eacute; superlattices.

  <!-- ===== 4. Numerical Methods ===== -->
  <section id="numerical">
    <h2>Numerical Methods</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to analytical approaches, our group actively develops and applies
      state-of-the-art numerical methods to study strongly correlated quantum systems.
      These computational tools allow us to go beyond mean-field descriptions and obtain
      unbiased or highly accurate results for challenging many-body problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work in this area includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)</strong> &mdash;
        We use DMRG to study ground-state properties of one-dimensional and
        quasi-one-dimensional strongly correlated systems, including Kondo lattice
        models with ultra-local criticality and doped Haldane chains hosting
        pair-density-wave superconductivity.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)</strong> &mdash;
        We develop variational wavefunctions based on ancilla qubits and
        parton constructions for Mott insulators, pseudogap metals, and
        spin liquid states, and optimize them using Monte Carlo sampling.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Neural network quantum states</strong> &mdash;
        We explore the use of neural network ansatze as variational wavefunctions
        for strongly correlated systems, leveraging their expressive power
        to capture complex entanglement structures in quantum many-body problems.
